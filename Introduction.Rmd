# Introduction

Kelp forests constitute one of the largest, most complex, and most threatened ecosystems in the Channel Islands National Park (CINP). Located at the boundary of two major biogeographical provinces and near unusually persistent upwelling features, the park is endowed with marine ecosystems of exceptional diversity. The five park islands are surrounded by extensive kelp forest habitat that is highly productive and relatively isolated from the mainland making them among the best examples of this important ecosystem in southern California.

The park boundary extends one nautical mile around each of the five islands, including the waters and submerged lands therein. These waters constitute less than 3% of California’s coastal zone, yet they are responsible for about 15% of the State’s coastal fishery harvests (source*). Despite defined fishing seasons, individual size and bag limits, and restricted uses in some areas, there are still no limits on total harvest of fish, lobster, algae, and other marine organisms from park waters. With the impact of harvesting and the threat of chronic and acute pollution from mainland waste disposal and adjacent offshore petroleum development, the potential for major anthropogenic disturbances exacerbated by overfishing of these ecosystems is of great concern. Natural disturbances also play an important role in the park, yet very little information on the long-term dynamics of the system is available. Providing the information required to manage these resources effectively is a challenge, but without the knowledge, there is a risk of losing these resources. Managing and conserving kelp forests requires innovative approaches and a better understanding of the long term dynamics of the ecosystem than currently exists. The KFM Program now monitors 33 sites annually, providing the longest set of fishery independent data along the west coast. A subset of 24 sites can be used to make direct comparisons of SMRs (inside vs. outside) at four of the five islands in CINP. See figure 1 for a full map of CINP and all of the KFMP sites. Please see Appendix B table XX for detailed information on site locations metadata.

Within each site, there are various protocols to collect abundance, size frequency distribution, percent cover, and presence/absence data on all species of fish and select indicator species for invertebrates and algae. Certain species have been labeled as “indicator species” based on the following criteria, at the discretion of the program managers:

- specifically mentioned in the park's enabling legislation or protected by law (e.g. threatened or endangered)
-	legally harvested
-	exceptionally common or characteristic of entire communities
-	alien to the park/invasive species
-	endemic to the park, or extremely limited in distribution
-	well known or "charismatic"

Species-specific characteristics, such as ease of locating and counting, relative abundance, life history, and growth rate determine what protocols are used to survey each organism. At the discretion of the lead scientist, the protocol an organism is monitored on may change or it may be counted on multiple protocols. Data consistency is of the utmost importance; often, as an organism is going to be transitioned to a different protocol, it is counted on both protocols to assure the change keeps the data consistent within a protocol. For example, following the SSWD event of 2013-2014, giant-spined sea stars were transitioned to band transects to search more habitat, though they remained a species on 1 m² quadrats. please see Appendix B, table XX for a full list of species with their associated protocols and years monitored.

Through other long term monitoring projects (Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO), Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research (SBC LTER), Reef Check California (RCCA), etc), we have been able to confirm trends in kelp forest communities that are shown in our data/trends. One of the most drastic shifts follows SSWD that began a dramatic sea star die-off around 2013 (citation here). In a short time period, a stark decline in the number of sea stars is ubiquitous across sites regardless of MPA status. Additional trends include urchin and brittle star barrens, kelp deforestation, and abalone population declines (citations here). By consistently tracking sites through time, we can detect changes from a normal oscillation, which can often operate at the decadal scale, as well as changes from large scale environmental changes such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events.

In these analyses, we compare changes in diversity, community structure, and biomass over 15 years at our 24 SMR reference sites from 2005 to 2019. While we focused on invertebrate, fish, and algal community changes through time, large scale environmental changes are also addressed when relevant. Examples include population changes linked to ENSO events and SSWD causing the extirpation of a major rocky reef predator **Pycnopodia helianthoides** (sunflower stars).

The following plot shows the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), one of the major indicies used to track and define ENSO events and their relative strengths. Warm periods correspond to warm sea surface temperatures at the channel islands which drives many changes in species distribution. For example a warm water species may be found at a cold water island following an El Niño.
